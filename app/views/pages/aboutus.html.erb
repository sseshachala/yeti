Obi was one of the top developers for the SecondLife platform and ran a relatively successful business based on the platform. This was Obi's fulltime job for a few years. But the SecondLife platform did not live up to expectations, Obi's SecondLife business eventually crashed. After the crash, Obi moved from New York to New Jersey right across the street from South Munn Avenue. The move represented a new beginning for Obi. This new beginning was marked by the street signs of South Munn Avenue.
