=Yeti

Yeti is the Web UI for Ragios. Yeti is a light-weight Rails 3 app, runs Ragios as a Rails plugin. 

Ragois is a Ruby-based system and Network monitoring Tool. For more information on Ragios, see here: https://github.com/obi-a/Ragios.

To Run Ragios as a Unix/Linux daemon see here https://github.com/obi-a/Ragios/blob/master/README.rdoc

Yeti is still a work in progress. I will be cleaning it up and coding it over the next few days.
