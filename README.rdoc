=Yeti

Yeti is the Web UI for Ragios (the Ruby-based system and Network monitoring Tool. See here: https://github.com/obi-a/Ragios). Yeti is a light-weight Rails 3 app, runs Ragios as a Rails 3 plugin. To Run Ragios as a Unix/Linux daemon see here https://github.com/obi-a/Ragios/blob/master/README.rdoc

Yeti is still a work n progress. I will be cleaning it up and coding it over the next few days.
